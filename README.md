# AOM-Business-Case
Access Our Medicine (AOM) is an initiative launched in 2013 by TCI to address the global issue of affordable medicine. Our primary objective is to gather 1 million signatures to draw attention to the need for affordable healthcare and medication, influencing world leaders to take action. Utilizing a mix of digital campaigns, social media, and community engagement, we aim to build public support and place the issue on national and international agendas. Our project plan includes hiring skilled IT professionals, deploying PandaDoc for e-signature collection, and implementing strategic marketing efforts to achieve our goal. With an estimated budget of $370,622, we are focused on maximizing impact through targeted advertisements and robust IT infrastructure to support our mission.
